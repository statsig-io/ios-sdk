## Statsig iOS SDK

The Statsig iOS SDK for single user client environments. It works for both Swift and Objective-C. If you need a SDK for another language or server environment, check out our [other SDKs](https://docs.statsig.com/#sdks).

Statsig helps you move faster with feature gates (feature flags), and/or dynamic configs. It also allows you to run A/B/n tests to validate your new features and understand their impact on your KPIs.
